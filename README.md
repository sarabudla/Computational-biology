## Bioinformatics and Genomics Skills

I have experience with the following bioinformatics and genomics tasks:

- Linux Command-Line Navigation
- Understanding the differences between genomes, transcriptomes, and expression data
- Genome and Transcriptome Assembly and Annotation
- Knowledge of various genomic databases and their applicability for different bioinformatics tasks
- Sequence Data Download
- Data Format Handling with Python
- Running BLAST on the web and from the CLI
- Simultaneously querying multiple biological databases for data relevant to specific biological questions using Entrez queries
- Selecting the right sequence alignment method and parameters for a given task
- Annotating transcriptomes with KEGG pathways and GO terms
- Running a multiple sequence alignment program and interpreting the results
- Understanding Sequence Logos and determining information content
- Searching nucleotide and amino acid sequence data using regular expressions
- Assembling genomes and transcriptomes
