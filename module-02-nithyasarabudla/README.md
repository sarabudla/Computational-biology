### Tests

###Test1 : It test whether sequence1.txt file is nucleic acid or amino acid sequence.
opens the file.
reading the file content.
checks whether nucleotide is present in the sequences (nucleic_acid_sequence=["A","T","G","C", "a", "t", "c", "g"]).
if the sequence contains the nucloetide then its prints "it is an nucleic acid sequence".
else it prints "it is an amino acid sequence.

### Test2: It test whether sequence2.txt file is nucleic acid or amino acid sequence.
opens the file.
reading the file content.
checks whether nucleotide is present in the sequences (nucleic_acid_sequence=["A","T","G","C", "a", "t", "c", "g"]).
if the sequence contains the nucloetide then its prints "it is an nucleic acid sequence".
else it prints "it is an amino acid sequence.

### Test3: It test whether sequence3.txt file is nucleic acid or amino acid sequence.
opens the file.
reading the file content.
checks whether nucleotide is present in the sequences (nucleic_acid_sequence=["A","T","G","C", "a", "t", "c", "g"]).
if the sequence contains the nucloetide then its prints "it is an amino acid sequence".
else it prints "it is an nucleic acid sequence.
